## What is this?
I tend to forget about cool (to me) things I've thought about, so this is a platform for me to collect them.

I also like sharing with people these cool (to me) things and discussing them, so this serves that purpose too.

Topics I need to convert from my brain to text:
1. **Islam (or any religion) For the Logical Mind**: My friend and I watched a Neil deGrasse Tyson video which helped me overcome the fundamental blocker for me being more religious; how logic and religion mix.
2. **Food Optimization: How I Plan my Meals**: Recently moved far from home, which gave me full end-to-end control over my meal planning. It's a perfect problem to be solved using optimization techniques.
3. **How do EVs know to turn on brake lights**: Normal cars have a physical brake sensor, but EVs with one-pedal driving don't.
4. **Differences between Sikhism and Islam**: Have a Sikh friend and we talk about religion frequently; there are some pretty interesting differences between Islam and Sikhism.
5. **Breaking a World Record**: Lot of work to be done here, but I have a plan to try to be the fastest to visit all 48 lower mainland US states in a car. Current best is 86 hours.
6. **Historical Context of Israel/Palestine Issue**: I read some interesting literature on the topic, and I want to summarize in a longer-than-bullet point format. It puts into context a lot of actions from the US today, Iran's involvement and such.
7. **Apps I would Pay For**: The main one is a daily activity tracking app which automatically runs correlation analyses between all activities tracked and finds those with significant correlation. Then, tell me something like "The days you eat more than 2300 calories, you  are 27% less likely to pray Maghrib". _Problem:_ p-values can't be used for significance naively. This is because with a 5% threshold, if we track 100 things then we will just randomly get 5*5 out of those 100*100 pairs having significant correlations.
8. **Poetry**: Usually sound way better in my head. Also have to figure out how to write in Urdu on Markdown.
