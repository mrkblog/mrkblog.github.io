## What is this?
I tend to forget about cool (to me) things I've thought about, so this is a platform for me to collect them.

I also like sharing with people these cool (to me) things and discussing them, so this serves that purpose too.

Topics I need to convert from my brain to text:
1. **Islam (or any religion) For the Logical Mind**: My friend and I watched a Neil deGrasse Tyson video which helped me overcome the fundamental blocker for me being more religious; how logic and religion mix.
2. **Food Optimization: How I Plan my Meals**: Recently moved far from home, which gave me full end-to-end control over my meal planning. It's a perfect problem to be solved using optimization techniques.
3. **How do EVs know to turn on brake lights**: Normal cars have a physical brake sensor, but EVs with one-pedal driving don't.
4. **Differences between Sikhism and Islam**: Have a Sikh friend and we talk about religion frequently; there are some pretty interesting differences between Islam and Sikhism.
5. **Breaking a World Record**: Lot of work to be done here, but I have a plan to try to be the fastest to visit all 48 lower mainland US states in a car. Current best is 86 hours.
6. **Historical Context of Israel/Palestine Issue**: I read some interesting literature on the topic, and I want to summarize in a longer-than-bullet point format. It puts into context a lot of actions from the US today, Iran's involvement and such.
7. **Poetry**: Usually sound way better in my head. Also have to figure out how to write in Urdu on Markdown.
